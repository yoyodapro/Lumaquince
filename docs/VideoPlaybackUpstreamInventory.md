# Upstream video search inventory

Snapshot from 2026-11-04, Djihads80/Eglantine. Separate `gh pr list` and
`gh issue list` queries used `--state all --limit 1000 --search` with each of
`video`, `movie`, `vdec`, `H.264`, `VP9`, `AV1`, `codec`, and `cutscene`.
All 72 PR and 53 issue matches are retained, including incidental matches in
`video_core` names and logs. These are search hits, not 72 decoder fixes.
PR heads were fetched through `refs/pull/<number>/head` and git diffs were used
because the PR diff API returned a rate-limit error.

Fetched upstream video branches:

- `fix/nx2-gsv-906-video-session`
- `fix/nx2-gsv-912-decoder-image`
- `fix/nx2-video-av1`
- `fix/nx2-video-decode`
- `fix/nx2-video-newer-sdk`

See [port decisions](VideoPlaybackUpstreamAudit.md) for the selected changes.
