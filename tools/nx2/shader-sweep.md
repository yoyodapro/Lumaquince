# Offline shader sweep

`shader_sweep.py` runs native captures and serialized Vulkan shader environments through the
shader compiler and `spirv-val`. It does not start an emulator, access a GPU, or change input files.

## Run

Build the `shader-sweep` C++ target under `tools/shader-sweep`, then run:

```sh
python3 tools/nx2/shader_sweep.py \
    /path/to/native-dumps /path/to/cache/shader \
    --compiler /path/to/shader-sweep \
    --output /path/to/sweep-before
```

Install SPIRV-Tools so `spirv-val` is on `PATH`, or pass `--spirv-val /path/to/spirv-val`.
The script validates against Vulkan 1.2. `--jobs` controls concurrent compiler subprocesses and
`--timeout` bounds each compiler and validator invocation. Every shader runs in its own process,
so an assertion, crash, or hang becomes a result rather than stopping the rest of the sweep.

The output directory contains `results.json`, a grouped `summary.md`, and the individual
environment records, pipeline keys, lowered code, and SPIR-V modules in `records/`.
The command exits nonzero if any input, context, compiler, or validation failure remains.

After changing the lowering, preserve the original native-to-cache matches:

```sh
python3 tools/nx2/shader_sweep.py \
    /path/to/native-dumps /path/to/cache/shader \
    --compiler /path/to/shader-sweep \
    --contexts-from /path/to/sweep-before/results.json \
    --output /path/to/sweep-after
```

Keep the earlier output directory. Its extracted environments and keys supply context when the
new lowering no longer produces the exact bytes stored in the older cache.

## Inputs and coverage

The loader reads little-endian `yuzucach` Vulkan caches, fork versions 46 through 50. It verifies each
record boundary and rejects unknown versions or truncated input. Version 47 includes captured
storage-pointer classifications; versions 48 through 50 retain that layout and version 46 omits them.
Version 49 invalidates pipelines after tessellation patch-size clamping. Version 50 captures the
additional texture-table context needed by dynamic texture/static sampler composition. Neither
changes the serialized layout.
Graphics keys are the 1,056-byte layout
from these versions; compute keys contain 24 bytes. Driver pipeline blobs and `vulkan_used`
indexes do not contain replayable shader environments and are not treated as shader inputs.

An environment preserves its actual shader stage, header, constant-buffer reads, texture types,
formats, compute workgroup size, and shared/local memory sizes. Cache entries contain already
lowered Maxwell code, not the original native instructions. Replaying them tests translation,
optimization, and SPIR-V emission, but cannot recover native programs rejected before caching.

Normal `hash-gfx-address.bin` captures contain only native instructions. Their filename does not
identify a graphics stage. The sweep lowers these and matches the result against cached code,
excluding headers, scheduling words, padding, and the native address map. A match supplies the
captured stage and environment for a fresh lowering and compilation. It never labels every
graphics program as a vertex shader. `rejected-stage-N-address.bin` captures include a 128-byte
header; `N` is the Maxwell engine shader slot, not the `Shader::Stage` enumeration. Compute
captures use `hash-cs-address.bin`.

Missing context is reported separately from compiler failures. A missing stage, texture format,
constant-buffer value, or storage-pointer classification is not evidence of an unsupported GPU
instruction. Fixed-pipeline assumptions are included in the compiler's JSON diagnostics.
Validation establishes that the emitted module is structurally valid under the tested profile;
it does not establish correct pixels, synchronization, or behavior on every driver.

Native captures default to the game label `Mario Tennis Fever`; use `--dump-game` for another
game. Cache game labels come from their parent title-ID directory; unknown IDs remain visible
as IDs. Counts are distinct compile jobs, including different captured environments and pipeline
keys, not draw counts. Identical native files are deduplicated by content.

If a capture log establishes the stage of an uncached program, pass
`--native-stage 0123456789abcdef=tess-eval`, using its filename hash. This supplies only the
stage, not missing headers or resource data; full compilation still reports that context gap.

## Parser tests

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/nx2 -p test_shader_sweep.py -v
```

Keep bulk game captures and generated modules outside the repository. The small regression
environments in `tools/shader-sweep/fixtures` preserve captured programs that exposed backend
defects. Each records its source cache hash and byte offset. Run them with:

```sh
python3 tools/shader-sweep/test_captured.py /path/to/shader-sweep
```
